This repository serve as a backup and demonstration of the html/css code created during the "Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3" course on Udemy, ministered by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy.

This piece of code creates a basic responsive webpage to employ the techniques shown in the course, some changes had to be made as shown on the code comments, because some features either were deprecated or a workaround wasn't found because of the amalgamation of the css structures on the styles.css file.
